# `fireableItem`

The `fireableItem` table is available in all scripts for "fireable" items. The following types of items are considered "fireable":

- liquid items
- material items
- placeable object items
- thrown items
- tools (including beamaxes)

Active items are *not* considered "fireable", but have the `activeItem` table instead (see `activeitem.md`).
